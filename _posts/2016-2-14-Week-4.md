## What did you do this past week?
My partner and I started the Netflix project after Downing discussed it with the class on Monday. On Wednesday we had a guest speaker, Ben, talk about his job at Main Street Hub. I was very interested because I love theidea of interacting with customers and also giving back. I love the fact that they work with small companies. I hope to work for a company that does similar things like Main Street Hub after graduation. 

I really appreciate Downing inviting UTCS Alumni to come and talk to us about their careers. I think it gets me excited about working after graduation, despite the fact that I still have a year of school left.

## What's in your way?
I don't think I have anything in the way. I have a partner for project 2 and we have a good portion of the project done. I also caught up with the readings, so hopefully that pays off this week.

## What will you do next week?
I will finish up project 2 and also start studying for exams. I have two this upcoming week and then the exam for this class the week after. It feels like school just started and midterms are already here. I only hope that I don't burn out quickly this semester.

##Tip of the Week
While pair programming, don't be afraid to speak up if you have a way of solving a problem differently than your partner. It may be more efficient or lead to you and your partner conjuring up an even better solution.
