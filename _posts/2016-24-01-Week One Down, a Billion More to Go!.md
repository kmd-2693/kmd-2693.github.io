title: Week One Down, a Billion More to Go!
---
I finally got this site created! This was a pain to create because I actually tried to set github pages and Jekyll up via command line. After struggling with Jekyll for hours, I went ahead and used the pre-made helper that Downing suggested in one of the links on Piazza. 

I'll go ahead and get to the questions. They appear to be very similar to the questions one would answer during scrum, which is a part of the agile methodology. Agile methodology is used for product management and group organization. 

1. What did you do this past week?
I started my first week of classes for the spring semester. I'm actually excited because I'm not taking CS electives. I was estatic when I signed up for this course because I had just started learning web dev at my internship, so I felt like I could approach the class feeling less intimidated. I was wrong. I was terrified when I saw all the technology we will be using in this course because I have not touched most of those. I was also a little frightened by the fact that Downing will call students out in a random order to answer questions. I guess this is all for greater good though because it will help the students to pay attention in class. I also realized it's not so terrible once I was called on. He's no trying to trick anyone. In fact, it almost seems like you get a personalized learning experience just from him calling on you. I also started a small weightlifting group with a couple of girls. We were going to meet up before this course every week, but I ended up getting into a weightlifting class. We have now changed the days we meet to Tuesdays and Thursdays. I'mma be swole by the end of the semester. 

2. What's in your way?
My lack of confidence in doing well in the course. I believe that I have the ability to do well, but I always get intimidated by the seemlingly large amounts of people who are incredibly intelligent in CS. My time management is also hindering me. Not to worry though, as I saw this coming so I purchased a planner. 

3. What will you do next week?
 a.I will continue working on Collatz. I'm having issues setting up the dependencies and all that jazz. I get the gist of how to solve the actual problem, but all the different technologies are getting to me. I'm so scared of missing a step, as there as so many listed on the project page. 
b.I will be making my blog look prettier. I'm wondering where this will go because there are so many different aestethics I could accomplish for this blog.
c.I'll also be lifting everyday this week. I'm incredibly weak, so I am nervous yet excited to gain gainz. (See what I did there???)
